# Excel Seeder for Laravel
[![PHPUnit tests](https://github.com/bfinlay/laravel-excel-seeder/actions/workflows/github-actions.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/bfinlay/laravel-excel-seeder/actions/workflows/github-actions.yml)
> #### Seed your database using CSV files, XLSX files, and more with Laravel

With this package you can save time seeding your database. Instead of typing out seeder files, you can use CSV, XLSX, or any supported spreadsheet file format to load your project's database. There are configuration options available to control the insertion of data from your spreadsheet files.

This project was forked from [laravel-csv-seeder](https://github.com/jeroenzwart/laravel-csv-seeder) and rewritten to support processing multiple input files and to use the [PhpSpreadsheet](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet) library to support XLSX and other file formats.

### Features

- Support CSV, XLS, XLSX, ODF, Gnumeric, XML, HTML, SLK files through [PhpSpreadsheet](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet) library
- Seed from multiple spreadsheet files per Laravel seeder class
- Generate text output version of XLS spreadsheet for determining changes to XLS when branch merging
- Automatically resolve CSV filename to table name.
- Automatically resolve XLSX worksheet tabs to table names.
- Automatically map CSV and XLSX headers to table column names.
- Automatically determine delimiter for CSV files, including comma `,`, tab `\t`, pipe `|`, and semi-colon `;`
- Skip seeding data columns by using a prefix character in the spreadsheet column header.
- Hash values with a given array of column names.
- Seed default values into table columns.
- Adjust Laravel's timestamp at seeding.

### Scale
This package has been used on CSV files with 5 million rows per file while maintaining flat memory usage (no memory leaks).

### Testing
This package has PHPUnit tests run automatically by Github Actions.  Tests are added as enhancements are made or as bugs are found and fixed.

This package is tested against the following Laravel versions
* Laravel 5.8
* Laravel 6.x
* Laravel 7.x
* Laravel 8.x
* Laravel 9.x
* Laravel 10.x
* Laravel 11.x

## Installation
### Laravel 8.x, 9.x, 10.x, 11.x
- Require this package directly by `composer require --dev -W bfinlay/laravel-excel-seeder`
- Or add this package in your composer.json and run `composer update`

  ```
  "require-dev": {
    ...
    "bfinlay/laravel-excel-seeder": "^3.0",
    ...
  }
    ```
### Laravel 5.8, 6.x, 7.x
Laravel 5.8, 6.x, and 7.x require DBAL 2.x.  Because DBAL is a `require-dev` dependency of laravel, its version
constraint will not be resolved by composer when installing a child package.  However, this is easy to solve by specifying DBAL 2.x as
an additional dependency.

Note that Laravel 5.8, 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x are EOL.  See https://laravelversions.com/en.
These versions will continue to be supported by this package for as long as reasonably possible, thanks to github actions performing the testing.

To install for Laravel 5.8, 6.x, and 7.x:
- Require this package directly by `composer require --dev -W bfinlay/laravel-excel-seeder`
- Require the dbal package directly by `composer require --dev -W doctrine/dbal:^2.6`
- Or add these packages in your composer.json and run `composer update`

  ```
  "require-dev": {
    ...
    "bfinlay/laravel-excel-seeder": "^3.0",
    "doctrine/dbal": "^2.6"
    ...
  }
  ```


## Simplest Usage
In the simplest form, you can use the `bfinlay\SpreadsheetSeeder\SpreadsheetSeeder`
as is and it will process all XLSX files in `/database/seeds/*.xlsx` and `/database/seeders/*.xlsx` (relative to Laravel project base path).

Just add the SpreadsheetSeeder to be called in your `/database/seeds/DatabaseSeeder.php` (Laravel 5.8, 6.x, 7.x) or `/database/seeder/DatabaseSeeder.php` (Laravel 8.X and newer) class.

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;
use bfinlay\SpreadsheetSeeder\SpreadsheetSeeder;

class DatabaseSeeder extends Seeder
{
    /**
     * Seed the application's database.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function run()
    {
        $this->call([
            SpreadsheetSeeder::class,
        ]);
    }
}
```

Place your spreadsheets into the path `/database/seeds/` (Laravel 5.8, 6.x, 7.x) or `/database/seeders/` (Laravel 8.x and newer) of your Laravel project.

With the default settings, the seeder makes certain assumptions about the XLSX files:
* worksheet (tab) names match --> table names in database
* worksheet (tab) has a header row and the column names match --> table column names in database
* If there is only one worksheet in the XLSX workbook either the worksheet (tab) name or workbook filename must match a table in the database. 


An Excel example:

| first_name    | last_name     | birthday   |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Foo           | Bar           | 1970-01-01 |
| John          | Doe           | 1980-01-01 |

A CSV example:
```
    first_name,last_name,birthday
    Foo,Bar,1970-01-01
    John,Doe,1980-01-01
```


## Basic usage
In most cases you will need to configure settings.
Create a seed class that extends `bfinlay\SpreadsheetSeeder\SpreadsheetSeeder` and configure settings on your class.  A seed class will look like this:
```php
use bfinlay\SpreadsheetSeeder\SpreadsheetSeeder;

class UsersTableSeeder extends SpreadsheetSeeder
{    
    /**
     * Run the database seeds.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function settings(SpreadsheetSeederSettings $set)
    {
        // By default, the seeder will process all XLSX files in /database/seeds/*.xlsx (relative to Laravel project base path)
        
        // Example setting
        $set->worksheetTableMapping = ['Sheet1' => 'first_table', 'Sheet2' => 'second_table'];
    }
}
```

note: the older process of overloading `run()` still works for backwards compatibility.

## Seeding Individual Sheets
By default, executing the `db:seed` Artisan command will seed all worksheets within a workbook.

If you want to specify individual sheets to seed, you may use the `xl:seed` Artisan command
with the `--sheet` option.  You may specify multiple `--sheet` options.

```
php artisan xl:seed --sheet=users --sheet=posts 
```

The above will run the `Database\Seeders\DatabaseSeeder` class, and for any SpreadsheetSeeders that are invoked
will only seed sheets named `users` and `posts`.  You may use the `--class` option to specify a specific seeder
class to run individually

```
php artisan xl:seed --class=MySpreadsheetSeederClass --sheet=users --sheet=posts
```

If you want to run the default `SpreadsheetSeeder` class, you can specify `--class=#`.  (The `#` resembles a spreadsheet.)

```
php artisan xl:seed --class=# --sheet=users --sheet=posts
```

For an easier syntax, you can also pass these as arguments and omit the --class and --seed.   When using arguments,  
the first argument must be the class, and subsequent arguments will be sheets.

```
php artisan xl:seed # users posts
```

Important note: as with seeding traditional seeder classes individually, when seeding individual sheets if the truncate option is true,
relations with cascade delete will also be deleted.

## Excel Text Output for Branch Diffs
After running the database seeder, a subdirectory will be created using
the same name as the input file.  A text output file will be created
for each worksheet using the worksheet name.  This text file contains a text-based representation of each
worksheet (tab) in the workbook and can be used to determine
changes in the XLSX when merging branches from other contributors.

Two formats are currently supported.   The older format is 'markdown' and is the defualt for backward compatibility.
The newer format is 'yaml' which is meant to work better with typical line-oriented diff software.

Check this file into the repository so that it can serve as a basis for
comparison.

You will have to merge the XLSX spreadsheet manually.

TextOutput can be disabled by setting `textOutput` to `FALSE`

See [Text Output](#text-output) for more information.

### Add Columns
`$addColumns` *(array [])*

This is an array of column names that will be column names in addition to
those found in the worksheet.

These additional columns will be processed the same ways as columns found
in a worksheet.  Cell values will be considered the same way as "empty" cells
in the worksheet.  These columns could be populated by parsers, defaults, or uuids.

Example: ['uuid, 'column1', 'column2']

Default: []

### Column Aliases
`$aliases` *(array [])*

This is an associative array to map the column names of the data source
to alternative column names (aliases).

Example: `['CSV Header 1' => 'Table Column 1', 'CSV Header 2' => 'Table Column 2']`

Default: `[]`

### Batch Insert Size
`$batchInsertSize` *(integer)*

Number of rows to insert in a batch.

Default: `5000`

### Date Formats
`$dateFormats` *(array [])*

This is an associative array mapping column names in the data source to
date format strings that should be used by Carbon to parse the date.
Information to construct date format strings is here:
[https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.createfromformat.php](https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.createfromformat.php)

When the destination column in the database table is a date time format,
and the source data is a string, the seeder will use Carbon to parse the
date format.  In many cases Carbon can parse the date automatically
without specifying the date format.

When Carbon cannot parse the date automatically, map the column name in
this array to the date format string.   When a source column is mapped,
Carbon will use the date format string instead of parsing automatically.

If column mapping is used (see [mapping](#mapping)) the column name should match the
value in the $mapping array instead of the value in the file, if any.

Example:
```
[
  'order_date' => 'Y-m-d H:i:s.u+',  // parses "2020-10-04 05:31:02.440000000"
]
```

Default: `[]`

### Defaults
`$defaults` *(array [])*

This is an associative array mapping column names in the data source to
default values that will override any values in the datasource.

Example: `['created_by' => 'seed', 'updated_by' => 'seed]`

Default: `[]`

### Delimiter
`$delimiter` *(string NULL)*

The delimiter used in CSV, tab-separate-files, and other text delimited
files.  When this is not set, the phpspreadsheet library will
automatically detect the text delimiter

Default: `null`

### Data Source File Default Extension
`$extension` *(string 'xlsx'*)

The default extension used when a directory is specified in $this->file

Default: `"xlsx"`

```php
use bfinlay\SpreadsheetSeeder\SpreadsheetSeeder;

class UsersTableSeeder extends SpreadsheetSeeder
{    
    /**
     * Run the database seeds.
     *
     * @return void
     */
     
    public function settings(SpreadsheetSeederSettings $set)
    {
        // specify relative to Laravel project base path
        // feature directories specified
        $set->file = [
            '/database/seeds/feature1', 
            '/database/seeds/feature2',
            '/database/seeds/feature3', 
            ]; 
        
        // process all xlsx and csv files in paths specified above
        $set->extension = ['xlsx', 'csv'];        
    }
}
```

### Data Source File

`$file` *(string*) or *(array []*) or *(Symfony\Component\Finder\Finder*)

This value is the path of the Excel or CSV file used as the data
source. This is a string or array[] and is list of files or directories
to process, which can include wildcards.  It can also be set to an instance
of [Symfony Finder](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/finder.html),
which is a component that is already included with Laravel.

By default, the seeder will process all XLSX files in /database/seeds (for Laravel 5.8 - 7.x)
and /database/seeders (for Laravel 8.x and newer).

The path is specified relative to the root of the project

Default: `"/database/seeds/*.xlsx"`

```php
use bfinlay\SpreadsheetSeeder\SpreadsheetSeeder;

class UsersTableSeeder extends SpreadsheetSeeder
{    
    /**
     * Run the database seeds.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function settings(SpreadsheetSeederSettings $set)
    {
        // specify relative to Laravel project base path
        $set->file = [
            '/database/seeds/file1.xlsx', 
            '/database/seeds/file2.xlsx',
            '/database/seeds/seed*.xlsx', 
            '/database/seeds/*.csv']; 
    }
}
```

This setting can also be configured to an instance of
[Symfony Finder](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/finder.html),
which is a component that is already included with Laravel.

When using Finder, the path is not relative to `base_path()` by default.
To make the path relative to `base_path()` prepend it to the finder path.
You could also use one of the other [Laravel path helpers](https://laravel.com/docs/master/helpers#method-base-path) .

Example:
```php
use bfinlay\SpreadsheetSeeder\SpreadsheetSeeder;

class UsersTableSeeder extends SpreadsheetSeeder
{    
    /**
     * Run the database seeds.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function settings(SpreadsheetSeederSettings $set)
    {
        // specify relative to Laravel project base path
        $set->file =
            (new Finder)
                ->in(base_path() . '/database/seeds/')
                ->name('*.xlsx')
                ->notName('*customers*')
                ->sortByName();
    }
}
```

### Hashable
`$hashable` *(array ['password'])*

This is an array of column names in the data source that should be hashed
using Laravel's `Hash` facade.

The hashing algorithm is configured in `config/hashing.php` per
[https://laravel.com/docs/master/hashing](https://laravel.com/docs/master/hashing)

Example: `['password']`

Default: `[]`


### Header
`$header` *(boolean TRUE)*

If the data source has headers in the first row, setting this to true will
skip the first row.

Default: `TRUE`

### Input Encodings
`$inputEncodings` *(array [])*

Array of possible input encodings from input data source
See [https://www.php.net/manual/en/mbstring.supported-encodings.php](https://www.php.net/manual/en/mbstring.supported-encodings.php)

This value is used as the "from_encoding" parameter to mb_convert_encoding.
If this is not specified, the internal encoding is used.

Default: `[]`

### Limit
`$limit` *(int*)

Limit the maximum number of rows that will be loaded from a worksheet.
This is useful in development to keep loading time fast.

This can be used in conjunction with settings in the environment file or App::environment() (APP_ENV) to limit data rows in the development environment.

Example:
```php
use bfinlay\SpreadsheetSeeder\SpreadsheetSeeder;

class SalesTableSeeder extends SpreadsheetSeeder
{    
    /**
     * Run the database seeds.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function settings(SpreadsheetSeederSettings $set)
    {
        $set->file = '/database/seeds/sales.xlsx';
        if (App::environment('local'))
            $set->limit = 10000;
    }
}
```

Default: null


### Column "Mapping"
`$mapping` *(array [])*

Backward compatibility to laravel-csv-seeder

This is an array of column names that will be used as headers.

If $this->header is true then the first row of data will be skipped.
This allows existing headers in a CSV file to be overridden.

This is called "Mapping" because its intended use is to map the fields of
a CSV file without a header line to the columns of a database table.


Example: `['Header Column 1', 'Header Column 2']`

Default: `[]`

### Offset
`$offset` *(integer)*

Number of rows to skip at the start of the data source, excluding the
header row.

Default: `0`

### Output Encodings
`$outputEncoding` *(string)*

Output encoding to database
See [https://www.php.net/manual/en/mbstring.supported-encodings.php](https://www.php.net/manual/en/mbstring.supported-encodings.php)

This value is used as the "to_encoding" parameter to mb_convert_encoding.

Default: `UTF-8`

### Parsers
`$parsers` *(array ['column' => function($value) {}])*

This is an associative array of column names in the data source that should be parsed
with the specified parser.

Example: 
```php
['email' => function ($value) {
     return strtolower($value);
}];
```

Default: []

### Read Chunk Size
`$readChunkSize` *(integer)*

Number of rows to read per chunk.

Default: `5000`

### Skipper
`$skipper` *(string %)*

This is a string used as a prefix to indicate that a column in the data source
should be skipped.  For Excel workbooks, a worksheet prefixed with
this string will also be skipped.  The skipper prefix can be a
multi-character string.

- Example: Data source column `%id_copy` will be skipped with skipper set as `%`
- Example: Data source column `#id_copy` will be skipped with skipper set as `#`
- Example: Data source column `[skip]id_copy` will be skipped with skipper set as `[skip]`
- Example: Worksheet `%worksheet1` will be skipped with skipper set as `%`

Default: `"%"`;

### Skip Columns
`$skipColumns` *(array [])*

This is an array of column names that will be skipped in the worksheet.

This can be used to skip columns in the same way as the skipper character, but 
without modifying the worksheet.

Example: ['column1', 'column2']

Default: []

### Skip Sheets
`$skipSheets` *(array [])*

This is an array of worksheet names that will be skipped in the workbook.

This can be used to skip worksheets in the same way as the skipper character,
but without modifying the workbook.

Example: ['Sheet1', 'Sheet2']

Default: []

### Destination Table Name
`$tablename` *(string*)

Backward compatibility to laravel-csv-seeder

Table name to insert into in the database.  If this is not set then
the tablename is automatically resolved by the following rules:
- if there is only 1 worksheet in a file and the worksheet is not the name of a table, use the base filename
- otherwise use worksheet name

Use worksheetTableMapping instead to map worksheet names to alternative
table names

Default: `null`

```php
use bfinlay\SpreadsheetSeeder\SpreadsheetSeeder;

class UsersTableSeeder extends SpreadsheetSeeder
{    
    /**
     * Run the database seeds.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function settings(SpreadsheetSeederSettings $set)
    {
        // specify relative to Laravel project base path
        // specify filename that is automatically dumped from an external process
        $set->file = '/database/seeds/autodump01234456789.xlsx';  // note: could alternatively be a csv
        
        // specify the table this is loaded into
        $set->tablename = 'sales';
        
        // in this example, table truncation also needs to be disabled so previous sales records are not deleted
        $set->truncate = false;
    }
}
```

### Text Output
`$textOutput` *(boolean)* or *(string*) or *(array []*)

* Set to false to disable output of textual markdown tables.
* `true` defaults to `'markdown'` output for backward compatibility.
* `'markdown'` for markdown output
* `'yaml'` for yaml output
* `['markdown', 'yaml']` for both markdown and yaml output

Default: `TRUE`

### Text Output Path
`$textOutputPath` *(string)*
Note: In development, subject to change

Path for text output

After processing a workbook, the seeder outputs a text format of
the sheet to assist with diff and merge of the workbook.  The default path
is in the same path as the input workbook.  Setting this path places the output
files in a different location.

Default: "";

### Timestamps
`$timestamps` *(string/boolean TRUE)*

When `true`, set the Laravel timestamp columns 'created_at' and 'updated_at'
with the current date/time.

When `false`, the fields will be set to NULL

Default: `true`

### Truncate Destination Table
`$truncate` *(boolean TRUE)*

Truncate the table before seeding.

Default: `TRUE`

Note: does not currently support array of table names to exclude

See example for [tablename](#destination-table-name) above

### Truncate Destination Table Ignoring Foreign Key Constraints
`$truncateIgnoreForeign` *(boolean TRUE)*

Ignore foreign key constraints when truncating the table before seeding.

When `false`, table will not be truncated if it violates foreign key integrity.

Default: `TRUE`

Note: does not currently support array of table names to exclude


### Unix Timestamps
`$unixTimestamps` *(array [])*

This is an array of column names that contain values that should be
interpreted unix timestamps rather than excel timestamps.
See [Conversions: Date/Time values](#datetime-values)

If column mapping is used (see mapping) the column name should match the
value in the $mapping array instead of the value in the file, if any.

Note: this setting is currently global and applies to all files or
worksheets that are processed.  All columns with the specified name in all files
or worksheets will be interpreted as unix timestamps.  To apply differently to
different files, process files with separate Seeder instances.

Example: `['start_date', 'finish_date']`;

Default: `[]`

### UUID
`$uuid` *(array [])*

This is an array of column names in the data source that the seeder will generate 
a UUID for.

The UUID generated is a type 4 "Random" UUID using laravel Str::uuid() helper
https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/helpers#method-str-uuid

If the spreadsheet has the column and has a UUID value in the column, the seeder 
will use the UUID value from the spreadsheet.

If the spreadsheet has any other value in the column or is empty, the seder will
generate a new UUID value.

If the spreadsheet does not have the column, use [$addColumns](#add-columns) to 
add the column, and also use $uuid (this setting) to generate a UUID for the added column.

Example: ['uuid']

Default: []

### Validate
`$validate` *(array [])*

This is an associative array mapping column names in the data source that
should be validated to a Laravel Validator validation rule.
The available validation rules are described here:
[https://laravel.com/docs/master/validation#available-validation-rules](https://laravel.com/docs/master/validation#available-validation-rules)

Example:
```
[
  'email' => 'unique:users,email_address',
  'start_date' => 'required|date|after:tomorrow',
  'finish_date' => 'required|date|after:start_date'
]
```

Default: `[]`

### Worksheet Table Mapping
`$worksheetTableMapping` *(array [])*

This is an associative array to map names of worksheets in an Excel file
to table names.

Excel worksheets have a 31 character limit.

This is useful when the table name should be longer than the worksheet
character limit.

Example: `['Sheet1' => 'first_table', 'Sheet2' => 'second_table']`

Default: `[]`

```php
use bfinlay\SpreadsheetSeeder\SpreadsheetSeeder;

class UsersTableSeeder extends SpreadsheetSeeder
{    
    /**
     * Run the database seeds.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function settings(SpreadsheetSeederSettings $set)
    {
        // specify the table this is loaded into
        $set->worksheetTableMapping = [
            'first_table_name_abbreviated' => 'really_rather_very_super_long_first_table_name', 
            'second_table_name_abbreviated' => 'really_rather_very_super_long_second_table_name'
            ];
    }
}
```

## Details
#### Null values
- String conversions: 'null' is converted to `NULL`, 'true' is converted to `TRUE`, 'false' is converted to `FALSE`
- 'null' strings converted to `NULL` are treated as explicit nulls.  They are not subject to implicit conversions to default values. 
- Empty cells are set to the default value specified in the database table data definition, unless the entire row is empty
- If the entire row consists of empty cells, the row is skipped.  To intentionally insert a null row, put the string value 'null' in each cell

#### Date/Time values
When the destination table column is a date/time type, the cell value is converted to a Date/Time format.
- If the value is numeric, it is assumed to be an excel date value
- If the value is a string, it is parsed using [Carbon::parse](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/#api-instantiation) and formatted for the SQL query.
- If the value is a unix timestamp, specify the column name with the [Unix Timestamps](#unix-timestamps) setting to convert it as a unix timestamp instead of an excel timestamp.

## Examples
#### Table with specified timestamps and specified table name
Use a specific timestamp for 'created_at' and 'updated_at' and also
give the seeder a specific table name instead of using the CSV filename;

```php
use bfinlay\SpreadsheetSeeder\SpreadsheetSeeder;

class UsersTableSeeder extends SpreadsheetSeeder
{    
    /**
     * Run the database seeds.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function settings(SpreadsheetSeederSettings $set)
    {
        $set->file = '/database/seeds/csvs/users.csv';
        $set->tablename = 'email_users';
        $set->timestamps = '1970-01-01 00:00:00';
    }
}
```

#### Worksheet to Table Mapping
Map the worksheet tab names to table names.

Excel worksheet tabs have a 31 character limit.  This is useful when the table name should be longer than the worksheet tab character limit.

See [example](#worksheet-table-mapping) above

#### Mapping
Map the worksheet or CSV headers to table columns, with the following CSV;

##### XLSX
|    |               |               |
|----| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1  | Foo           | Bar           |
| 2  | John          | Doe           |

##### CSV
    1,Foo,Bar
    2,John,Doe

Example:
```php
use bfinlay\SpreadsheetSeeder\SpreadsheetSeeder;

class UsersTableSeeder extends SpreadsheetSeeder
{    
    /**
     * Run the database seeds.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function settings(SpreadsheetSeederSettings $set)
    {
        $set->file = '/database/seeds/users.xlsx';
        $set->mapping = ['id', 'firstname', 'lastname'];
        $set->header = FALSE;
    }
}
```

Note: this mapping is a legacy laravel-csv-seeder option.   The mapping currently applies to all
worksheets within a workbook, and is currently designed for single sheet workbooks
and CSV files.

There are two workarounds for mapping different column headers for different input files or worksheets:
1. add header columns to your multi-sheet workbooks
2. use CSVs or single-sheet workbooks and create a separate seeder for each that need different column mappings

#### Aliases with defaults
Seed a table with aliases and default values, like this;

```php
use bfinlay\SpreadsheetSeeder\SpreadsheetSeeder;

class UsersTableSeeder extends SpreadsheetSeeder
{    
    /**
     * Run the database seeds.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function settings(SpreadsheetSeederSettings $set)
    {
        $set->file = '/database/seeds/csvs/users.csv';
        $set->aliases = ['csvColumnName' => 'table_column_name', 'foo' => 'bar'];
        $set->defaults = ['created_by' => 'seeder', 'updated_by' => 'seeder'];
    }
}
```

#### Skipper
Skip a worksheet in a workbook, or a column in an XLSX or CSV with a prefix. For example you use `id` in your worksheet which is only usable in your workbook. The worksheet file might look like the following:

| %id | first_name    | last_name     | %id_copy | birthday   |
|-----| ------------- | ------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| 1   | Foo           | Bar           | 1        | 1970-01-01 |
| 2   | John          | Doe           | 2        | 1980-01-01 |

The first and fourth value of each row will be skipped with seeding. The default prefix is '%' and changeable.  In this example the skip prefix is changed to 'skip:'

| skip:id | first_name    | last_name     | skip:id_copy | birthday   |
|---------| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| 1       | Foo           | Bar           | 1            | 1970-01-01 |
| 2       | John          | Doe           | 2            | 1980-01-01 |

```php
use bfinlay\SpreadsheetSeeder\SpreadsheetSeeder;

class UsersTableSeeder extends SpreadsheetSeeder
{    
    /**
     * Run the database seeds.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function settings(SpreadsheetSeederSettings $set)
    {
        $set->file = '/database/seeds/users.xlsx';
        $set->skipper = 'skip:';
    }
}
```

To skip a worksheet in a workbook, prefix the worksheet name with '%' or the specified skipper prefix.

#### Validate
Validate each row of an XLSX or CSV like this;
```php
use bfinlay\SpreadsheetSeeder\SpreadsheetSeeder;

class UsersTableSeeder extends SpreadsheetSeeder
{    
    /**
     * Run the database seeds.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function settings(SpreadsheetSeederSettings $set)
    {
        $set->file = '/database/seeds/users.xlsx';
        $set->validate = [ 'name'              => 'required',
                            'email'             => 'email',
                            'email_verified_at' => 'date_format:Y-m-d H:i:s',
                            'password'          => ['required', Rule::notIn([' '])]];
    }
}
```

#### Hash
Hash values when seeding an XLSX or CSV like this;
```php
use bfinlay\SpreadsheetSeeder\SpreadsheetSeeder;

class UsersTableSeeder extends SpreadsheetSeeder
{    
    /**
     * Run the database seeds.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function settings(SpreadsheetSeederSettings $set)
    {
        $set->file = '/database/seeds/users.xlsx';
        $set->hashable = ['password'];
    }
}
```

#### Input and Output Encodings
The mb_convert_encodings function is used to convert encodings.
* $this->inputEncodings is an array of possible input encodings.  Default is `[]` which defaults to internal encoding.  See [https://www.php.net/manual/en/mbstring.supported-encodings.php]
* $this->outputEncoding is the output encoding.  Default is 'UTF-8';
```php
use bfinlay\SpreadsheetSeeder\SpreadsheetSeeder;

class UsersTableSeeder extends SpreadsheetSeeder
{    
    /**
     * Run the database seeds.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function settings(SpreadsheetSeederSettings $set)
    {
        $set->file = '/database/seeds/users.xlsx';
        $set->inputEncodings = ['UTF-8', 'ISO-8859-1'];
        $set->outputEncoding = 'UTF-8';
    }
}
```

#### Postgres Sequence Counters
When using Postgres, Excel Seeder for Laravel will automatically update Postgres sequence counters for auto-incrementing id columns.

MySQL automatically handles the sequence counter for its auto-incrementing columns.
